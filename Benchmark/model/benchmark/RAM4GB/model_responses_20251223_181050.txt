      "task": "Summarize the content of the AI news articles found in subtask 1",
      "depends_on": [1]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Subtask 1 involves searching for recent AI news articles. This task is independent and does not require any output from another task, hence "depends_on": []
- Subtask 2 involves summarizing the content of the AI news articles found in subtask 1. This task depends on the output of subtask 1, hence "depends_on": [1]

    }
  ]
}
```

In this decomposition, we have a single subtask that involves a mathematical calculation. There are no dependencies on other subtasks, as the task is self-contained and does not require any additional information or results from other calculations. The task is assigned to the "tasks/math" channel because it is a calculation.

The output JSON structure clearly indicates that there is only one subtask, which is a mathematical calculation. The "depends_on" array is empty, signifying that this subtask does not depend on any other subtasks and can be executed independently.

If we were to expand this task into a more complex workflow, we might include additional subtasks for explaining the concept of calculating a percentage or for verifying the result. However, for the given task, only the calculation is necessary.

Here is how the JSON structure would look with the given task:

Response:
Here is the JSON output representing the decomposition of the task into subtasks, with the appropriate dependencies:

```json
{

      "channel": "tasks/code",
      "task": "Generate SQL query to select all users",
      "depends_on": []
    }
  ]
}
```

In this decomposition, only one subtask is required, which is the generation of the SQL query. There are no dependencies on other subtasks since this task is self-contained and does not require any preliminary calculations, textual explanations, or image generation. The task is purely about writing code, which is why it is assigned to the "tasks/code" channel.

If we were to break down the task further for educational purposes, we could create additional subtasks, such as explaining the structure of the SQL query or discussing the importance of SQL in database management. However, these would not be necessary for the actual execution of the task. Here's an example of how it might look with additional educational subtasks:

    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
The task decomposition consists of a single subtask that falls under the "tasks/math" channel. This subtask involves performing a mathematical calculation, specifically finding the derivative of the function x^2. There are no dependencies on other tasks, as indicated by the empty "depends_on" array.

Here is the mathematical formula for the derivative of x squared:

d/dx (x^2) = 2x

This subtask does not require code generation, text summaries, or image generation, hence there are no additional subtasks associated with it.

      "task": "Generate Python code to connect to MySQL database",

    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
The task of connecting to a MySQL database can be accomplished by writing a piece of code. Since this task does not require any mathematical calculations, text summaries, or image generation, it falls under the "tasks/code" category. The subtask is self-contained and does not depend on any other subtasks, hence "depends_on" is an empty array.

Here is an example of Python code that could be generated to connect to a MySQL database:

```python
import mysql.connector

def connect_to_mysql_database(host, user, password, database):
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host,

Prompt: Calculate the area of circle with radius 7

Here is the JSON output representing the decomposition of the task into subtasks:

      "task": "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 7",
      "depends_on": []
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, we only have one subtask, which is a mathematical calculation. There is no dependency on other tasks, so the "depends_on" array is empty. The task is assigned to the "tasks/math" channel because it involves a mathematical formula.

If we were to break down the task further, for example, by explaining the formula or generating code to perform the calculation, we would create additional subtasks. However, since the original request is to calculate the area, we only need one subtask.

Here's how it would look if we added an explanation subtask:

- Subtask 1 involves writing SQL code, which is a task that can be executed independently. The task is to generate a SQL query to select all users from a database. This subtask does not depend on any other subtask.
- Subtask 2 requires an understanding of database normalization, which is a conceptual explanation that should be provided after the SQL query is generated. This subtask depends on the completion of Subtask 1, as the context for normalization (the structure of the database) is provided by the SQL query.

The JSON structure clearly indicates that Subtask 2 depends on the completion of Subtask 1, as indicated

Explanation:
- Subtask 1 involves a mathematical calculation to find the mean of the given numbers. This task does not depend on any other task, hence "depends_on": []
- Subtask 2 requires an explanation of statistical significance, which is a conceptual task that would typically follow the calculation. It depends on the result of Subtask 1, so "depends_on": [1]

The JSON structure clearly indicates the dependencies between the tasks, with Subtask 2 depending on the completion of Subtask 1. The tasks are decomposed into two separate sub

Explanation:
- Subtask 1 involves writing Python code to establish a connection to a MySQL database. This task does not depend on any other task, hence "depends_on": []
- Subtask 2 requires the connection established in Subtask 1 to define a connection pooling mechanism. Therefore, it depends on the output of Subtask 1, hence "depends_on": [1]

These tasks are sequential and cannot run in parallel, as Subtask 2 cannot be executed without first establishing a connection to the database, which is the responsibility of Subtask 1. The JSON format correctly represents this dependency

Explanation:
- Subtask 1 is a mathematical task where we calculate the factorial of 5. This is a standalone task that does not depend on any other task.
- Subtask 2 is a code generation task where we will write a recursive Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. This task depends on the result of Subtask 1, as we need to understand the factorial of 5 to generate the correct code.

Here is the Python code for Subtask 2:

Explanation:
The user's request can be decomposed into two separate subtasks:

1. Calculate the square root of 144.
   - This is a mathematical task and does not depend on any other task.
   - The agent assigned for this task is "tasks/math".

2. Explain the Babylonian method.
   - This is an educational task that requires a textual explanation.
   - The agent assigned for this task is "tasks/text".

Since these two tasks are independent of each other, they can run in parallel. Therefore, there is no "depends_on" relationship between
