  "conclusion": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves 81% accuracy on mathematical calculations with 2GB RAM, representing an 11.6x improvement over flan-t5-base (7%). Despite occasional reasoning loops causing latency spikes, the model demonstrates strong arithmetic capabilities and formula application, making it viable for edge deployment where mathematical reasoning is required. The 2GB RAM requirement is realistic for modern edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4)."
